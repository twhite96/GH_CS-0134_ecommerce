# Mock e-commerce Site for CS 0134
> Purely a static e-commerce site for Pitt's CS 0134, Web Development Class

[![Travis branch](https://img.shields.io/travis/twhite96/ecommerce-site/master.svg?maxAge=2592000)](https://travis-ci.org/twhite96/ecommerce-site)

This site is simple: How do you design and code a functional e-commerce site? By using Bootstrap and customizing it with a few flexbox elements thrown in. Also for the first iteration, we'll use CSS animations instead of jQuery or JavaScript. For v.1.1, jQuery and JavaScript will be added.

## Installation
If you want to improve upon what I have done here, there are really not a lot of dependencies. You will need Bootstrap.

## Usage examples

You could use this to practice building static sites and hosting them on your free server of choice.

## Development setup

If you wish to test each build with Travis CI, you can do so by making a ```package.json``` file using

```sh
npm init
```

And filling out the details. You will also need to install `Gulp`:

```sh
npm install gulp --save
```
You will also need a Gulpfile.

## Release History

None right now.
